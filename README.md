# ADAPTIVE-HVAC-FOR-SMART-BUILDINGS-USING-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-FRAMEWORK

This repository presents an advanced implementation of an adaptive Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control system for smart buildings, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize energy efficiency while ensuring occupant comfort. The system employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train an intelligent agent within a simulated building environment, demonstrating a scalable and robust approach to modern building management. This project is designed for researchers, engineers, and practitioners seeking to develop energy-efficient, intelligent HVAC systems for sustainable smart infrastructure.


INTRODUCTION


Buildings account for a significant portion of global energy consumption, with HVAC systems contributing substantially to operational costs and carbon emissions. Traditional HVAC control strategies, often reliant on static, rule-based logic, lack the adaptability to respond to dynamic environmental conditions, occupancy patterns, and energy demands. This inefficiency leads to excessive energy use and suboptimal occupant comfort. To address these challenges, this project leverages reinforcement learning to develop an adaptive HVAC control system capable of making real-time, data-driven decisions. By modeling the HVAC control problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), the system optimizes energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort and indoor air quality, paving the way for scalable, intelligent building management solutions.The primary objective of this project is to train a PPO-based RL agent to dynamically adjust HVAC parameters in a simulated smart building environment. The system integrates sensor data, energy consumption metrics, and occupant comfort requirements to learn an optimal control policy. This repository provides a comprehensive implementation, including data preprocessing, environment simulation, agent training, and performance evaluation, with detailed documentation for reproducibility and further development.


METHODOLOGY


The methodology encompasses problem formulation, environment design, agent configuration, and data management, ensuring a rigorous and systematic approach to adaptive HVAC control.

2.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION

The HVAC control task is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the following components:

1. STATES (S):

A multidimensional state space capturing environmental variables, including:

A. Indoor temperature (°C)

B. Outdoor temperature (°C)

C. Relative humidity (%)

D. CO2 concentration (ppm)

E. Occupancy levels (number of occupants)

F. Time of day and seasonality


2. ACTIONS (A):

Continuous or discrete control actions, such as:

A. Adjusting temperature setpoints

B. Modulating fan speeds

C. Controlling variable air volume (VAV) dampers

D. Activating/deactivating heating or cooling units

3. REWARD FUNCTION (R):

A composite function balancing:

A. Energy Efficiency: Minimizing consumption of electricity, gas, and water, measured in kWh, therms, and gallons, respectively.

B. Occupant Comfort: Maintaining indoor temperature and humidity within predefined comfort ranges (e.g., 20–24°C, 40–60% humidity).

C. Air Quality: Ensuring CO2 levels remain below acceptable thresholds (e.g., <1000 ppm).

4. TRANSITION DYNAMICS (P):

Probabilistic transitions based on building physics, occupancy patterns, and external weather conditions.
Objective: Maximize the expected cumulative discounted reward.


2.2 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AGENT

The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art policy-gradient method, was selected for its stability, sample efficiency, and effectiveness in continuous control tasks. PPO balances exploration and exploitation by constraining policy updates within a trust region, using a clipped surrogate 

The agent employs a neural network with two fully connected layers (64 units each, ReLU activation) for both the policy and value functions.


2.3 SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT

A custom OpenAI Gym-like environment was developed to simulate a smart building’s HVAC system. 

Key components include:

A. Sensors: Real-time measurements of indoor/outdoor temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and occupancy.

B. Actuators: VAV systems, heating/cooling coils, and ventilation controls.

C. Energy Meters: Tracking electricity, gas, and water consumption.

D. Building Dynamics: Simplified thermal models approximating heat transfer, air circulation, and occupancy effects.

The environment supports configurable parameters, such as building size, insulation properties, and climate conditions, enabling flexible experimentation.

2.4 Dataset

The training dataset, stored in ADAPTIVE_HVAC_DATASET.xlsx, comprises 75,000 entries across 27 columns, capturing a rich set of building-related metrics:

A. Environmental Variables: Indoor/outdoor temperature, humidity, CO2 levels.

B. Energy Metrics: Electricity (kWh), gas (therms), and water (gallons) consumption.

C. Occupancy Data: Number of occupants and activity patterns.

D. Temporal Features: Time of day, day of week, and seasonal indicators.

The dataset was rigorously validated to ensure no missing values, duplicates, or outliers, providing a reliable foundation for training and analysis.

3. IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW


The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, with a structured workflow to ensure reproducibility and clarity. 

The key steps are:

A. Data Acquisition:Load the ADAPTIVE_HVAC_DATASET.xlsx file using pandas.

B. Verify dataset dimensions (75,000 rows, 27 columns) and data types.

C. Data Preprocessing and Validation: 

- Check for missing values (df.isnull().sum()), duplicates (df.duplicated().sum()), and inconsistencies.

- Normalize numerical features (e.g., temperature, energy consumption) to ensure stable training.

D. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Compute statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation) for key variables.

- Visualize distributions (histograms, box plots) and correlations (heatmap) using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Identify relationships between variables, such as temperature and energy consumption.

D. Environment Setup:

- Define a custom Gym environment with state space (e.g., sensor readings), action space (e.g., HVAC controls), and reward function.

- Implement step dynamics to simulate building responses to control actions.


E. Model Selection and Configuration:

- Select PPO from stable-baselines3 for its robustness in continuous control tasks.

- Configure hyperparameters:Learning rate: 0.0003

- Discount factor (γ): 0.99

- Clip range (ϵ): 0.2

- Batch size: 64

- Number of epochs: 10


F. Agent Training:

- Initialize the PPO agent with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) policy.

- Train the agent for 4,096 timesteps across 2 iterations, logging performance metrics.

G. Evaluation:

- Monitor training progress through metrics such as policy loss, value loss, and explained variance.

- Visualize learning curves to assess convergence and stability.

4. RESULTS PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS

The PPO agent was trained for 2 iterations, accumulating 4,096 timesteps. The following metrics were logged, providing insights into the training dynamics:

- Approximate KL Divergence: 0.010221228, indicating that policy updates remained within the trust region, ensuring stable learning.

- Policy Gradient Loss: -0.00903, reflecting improvements in the policy’s ability to maximize expected rewards.

- Value Loss: 90.4, representing the mean squared error in the value function’s predictions of future rewards.

- Explained Variance: -0.0148, suggesting that the value function struggles to capture the variability in returns, indicating potential for improvement.

- Learning Rate: 0.0003, a conservative value to prevent overfitting and ensure gradual learning.

- Entropy Loss: -7.07, reflecting the agent’s exploration behavior, with lower entropy indicating a more deterministic policy.

- Total Loss: 9.62, combining policy, value, and entropy losses to guide optimization.

These metrics suggest that the agent is making progress toward learning an effective HVAC control policy, though further training and hyperparameter tuning are needed to improve performance. Visualizations of training curves (e.g., reward over time) are included in the notebook to facilitate analysis.
